# Question

What's the difference between "semantic" and "non-semantic" elements?

## Answer

Semantic tags are able to tell the browser information about the content that's within the tag, unlike non-semantic tags/elements. This makes the code of the website more readable, thus the information more accessible.

# Teacher Feedback
2/3. You defined semantic tags correctly, here are a few examples - `h1`, `p`, and `a`. Non-semantic tags are used for grouping, example - `div` and `span`.
